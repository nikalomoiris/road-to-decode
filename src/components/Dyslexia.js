                           ​​Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that is
                           neurological in origin. It is characterized by
                           difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word
                           recognition and by poor spelling and decoding
                           abilities. These difficulties typically result from a
                           deficit in the phonological component of language
                           that is often unexpected in relation to other
                           cognitive abilities and the provision of effective
                           classroom instruction. Secondary consequences may
                           include problems in reading comprehension and reduced
                           reading experience that can impede growth of
                           vocabulary and background knowledge.

                           Although children with dyslexia may struggle with
                           reading, writing, and spelling, many are talented in
                           other areas such as art, engineering, architecture
                           and athletics. There have been many studies which
                           show the cause of this is the result of compensatory
                           achievement in non-verbal fields. Many children with
                           dyslexia show unusual and superior skill in drawing,
                           mechanical puzzles or building models at a very young
                           age. Continued recent research is showing that those
                           who have difficulities in language function, have
                           developed superior skills in other parts of the
                           nervous system.
