                           Children with dyslexia need additional help with
                           sorting, recognizing and organizing materials of
                           language for use. Orton Gillingham&#39;s direct and
                           systematic approach focuses on providing students
                           with knowledge about language and its relationship to
                           our writing system so that they may become skilled
                           readers and writers. It stresses language patterns
                           that determine order, structure and meaning of words
                           and phrases. The Orton Gillingham approach is
                           sequential, incremental and cumulative ensuring each
                           student masters each level of language
                           skills. Continuous feedback and positive
                           reinforcement is provided to encourage success
                           and self-confidence of the student.
