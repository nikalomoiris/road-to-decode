                    <strong>In Person Sessions</strong>
                    <br />
                    In person sessions include on site instruction using
                    the Orton Gillingham Approach. Materials are provided
                    for each child and work will be organized in a binder
                    which can be used as a reference for review if
                    needed. To further improve reading fluency, after
                    every lesson each child is provided with reading
                    material based on the lesson for the day.

                    <strong>Online Sessions</strong>
                    <br />
                    The online platform I have created is interactive and
                    engaging, offering successful instruction to
                    facilitate progress. I use the same techniques and
                    teaching materials as traditional onsite services.
                    Students love to use the online whiteboard for
                    writing! We also use an interactive application where
                    students are able to manipulate color coded letter
                    tiles to decode, read and spell words.

                    ​​Although teletherapy can be effective for the
                    majority of students, some children may require in
                    person sessions with cueing. To ensure each child
                    receives proper instruction, I offer a Free
                    Consultation and Free mini-lesson to determine if
                    online tutoring is appropriate.
