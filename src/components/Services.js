                    The online platform I have created is interactive
                    and engaging, offering successful instruction to
                    facilitate progress. I use the same techniques and
                    teaching materials as traditional onsite services.
                    Students love to use the online whiteboard for
                    writing! We also use an interactive application where
                    students are able to manipulate color coded letter
                    tiles to decode, read and spell words.

                    Although teletherapy can be effective for the
                    majority of students, some children may require in
                    person sessions with cueing.

                <p>
                    ​​To ensure each child receives proper instruction, I
                    offer a Free Consultation and Free mini-lesson to
                    determine if online tutoring is appropriate. I
                    provide 50 minute individualized lessons.
