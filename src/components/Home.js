                <br />
                Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that is
                neurological in origin. It is characterized by
                difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition
                and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. These
                difficulties typically result from a deficit in the
                phonological component of language that is often
                unexpected in relation to other cogntivie abilities and
                the provision of effective classroom instruction.
                Secondary consequences may include problems in reading
                comprehension and reduced reading experience that can
                impede growth of vocabulary and background knowledge.
