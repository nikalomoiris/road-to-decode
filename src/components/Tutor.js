                    Hi! I'm Georgia. I am a Certified Orton Gillingham
                    Practitioner, providing multi-sensory instruction to
                    children with reading and spelling difficulties. I
                    have received a Masters Degree in General and Special
                    Education and have worked with students in grades 1-6
                    since 2009, providing individualized instructional
                    support in Reading, Writing, and Math.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While working with my students, I noticed reading
                    difficulties which were affecting their progress in
                    all content areas. I wanted to find an approach
                    which supports Phonemic Awareness, so I began my
                    search for a method that has been proven to be
                    successful. After comparing various methods of
                    instruction available, I decided to further my
                    education to become certified in the Orton Gillingham
                    Approach to Reading, Spelling, and Writing.
                    It provides a systematic, structured, and
                    multisensory approach, which has been successfully
                    used for over 50 years!
                </p>
                <p>
                    While tutoring children with Dyslexia using the Orton
                    Gillingham Approach, my students have progressed
                    with outstanding reading fluency and spelling results
                    . It is a passion of mine to see children's
                    improvement in reading and writing, and it gives me
                    great joy to see their confidence grow as they
                    progress in these essential skills!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am strongly dedicated to providing specific
                    individualized lessons based on each students' needs
                    using the scientifically proven and effective Orton
                    Gillingham approach to instruct children with
                    Dyslexia and Language-based learning difficulties.
